# Wilderness Player Alarm
This is a plugin that will make your screen flash in alarm when another player enters the vicinity while you're in the
wilderness. Sometimes player indicators alone are hard to see on your second monitor-scout while you're focusing on that
Vet'ion kill. With this plugin, the flashing screen should sufficiently trigger your prey instinct towards threats in your peripheral vision
and allow you a slightly better chance to escape.
